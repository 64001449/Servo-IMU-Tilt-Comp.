# Servo-IMU-Tilt-Comp.

Overview: This is the code for the tilt feature of an anti-rotation device made by the MnSGC Ballooning Team.

Instructions for use: First, download the zip file for the code, and then open it up in Arduino or Teensyduino. Then, connect the servo and IMU to the Arduino Uno. (The servo's brown pin goes to GND, the orange pin to 5V, and the yellow pin to D9. The IMU's GND goes to GND, the VDD goes to 3.3V, the SDA to A4, and the SCL to A5). Then, just run the code.
